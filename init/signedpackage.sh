# NOTE: 
#  signedpackage.sh -- checks for and helps prepare a signed jar file. 
# 
#  1. On first run, signedpackage.sh takes the full path to an unsigned jar,
#     and if not present in /tmp, copies it there and prints a helpful message
#     for what to do next.
#  2. The operator is expected to sign the jar, and restart the build scripts.
#  3. On the second run, signedpackage.sh sees that there is a signed jar in 
#     /tmp, and overwrites the jar given on the command line.
# 
#  The calling script, is expected to include the resulting SIGNED java applet 
#  with the final package.
# 
#  ARGS:
#     - ORIG - full path to original, unsigned jar file.
#              if no file is present in /tmp, then 'cp ORIG /tmp'
#              if file is present in /tmp & signed, then 'cp /tmp/ORIG ORIG'
# 
#  DEPENDENCIES:
#     jarsigner - provided by a java JDK.
#                 NOTE: the GNU java compiler packages do not verify correctly.
# 
#  RETURNS:
#     - 0 - on successfully verifing a signed jar 
#     - 1 - on first run or other error
# 

# TODO: find an automated way. it's a security risk to include the cert on the
# build system; so at the moment, signing the jar requires a manual step.

    You can sign the jar file with a command like:

        # jarsigner -keystore mlab-java-signing-keystore $DEST mlab

    Once you've done that, verify that the signature is valid with:
    
        # jarsigner -certs -verbose -verify $DEST
    
    Replace $DEST with the signed version and rerun the build scripts.
    This script will automatically detect the signed version and use it.

        export DISABLE_APPLET_SIGNING=1

    If you are using 'sudo' be sure to include the variable in the sudo env.

        sudo DISABLE_APPLET_SIGNING=1 ./build.sh <slicename>
